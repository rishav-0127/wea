                        <p>Gulab jamun is an Indian dessert of fried dough balls that are soaked in a sweet, sticky sugar syrup. As per tradition, the syrup has a delicate rose flavour: Gulab means 'rose water' and jamun refers to a berry of a similar size and colour. <br><br>What Does Gulab Jamun Taste Like? Gulab jamun is traditionally served warm, drenched in sugar syrup, and offers a milky sweet aroma coupled with a melt-in-the-mouth tenderness. Some people define its taste as raisin-like with a subtle spiciness from the cardamom and a floral aroma from the rose syrup.</p>

                            <P>
                                Barfi or burfi is a milk-based sweet from the Indian subcontinent with a fudge-like consistency. Its name comes from the Persian and Urdu word (barf) for snow. Barfi is consumed throughout India and Pakistan and is especially popular in North India. <br><br>
                                Plain white Milk Barfi is one of the most popular Indian mithais that melts in your mouth! This version is made using milk powder, no khoya necessary, with a texture that is similar to a fudge and is flavored with luxurious saffron and cardamom. <br><br>
                                Good quality Burfi is characterized by moderately sweet taste, soft and slightly greasy body and smooth texture with very fine grains. It retains its quality for a considerable long period at atmospheric storage temperature due to its low moisture content and higher concentration.
